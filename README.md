# Estimation-of-Calorie-Content-in-a-Diet
Excessive calorie consumption has been evinced as noxious worldwide, as it is betraying to many harmful afflictions.
However, nutritionists have assayed that a calibrated intake of calories is vital to maintain the equitable balance of nutrition
and calorie content in human body. The intent of this research is to institute a machine learning model which is trained to
perceive food images and compute the volume and approximate the calorie content.In this proposed model convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to detect the food item and when the food item is recognized, the volume is computed by approximating the geometric shape like sphere, cylinder, etc. The model is trained using the Support Vector Machine model in which 94% accuracy is obtained in the classification of the food items. Once the volume is computed, the mass of the food item is computed using standard density tables.
